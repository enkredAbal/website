# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of *git tutorial*.

After finishing *This tutorial*, I'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*.
This means I'll be able to use Git to track changes in my projects,
back up data, share my work with others,
and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.

For more information on Git, see the
[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
